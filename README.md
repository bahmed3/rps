# Rock, Paper, Scissors Game
This project is a simple and interactive implementation of the popular game Rock, Paper, Scissors. I developed this as part of my learning journey to understand the fundamentals of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Objective
The objective of this project was to create an interactive game that can be played in a browser. The project also includes features such as a score tracking system, auto-play mode, and keyboard controls to deepen my understanding of how to create interactive experiences using web technologies.

## Technologies
- HTML5
- CSS3
- JavaScript

## Strategy
Here are the key strategies I employed:

### HTML
- **Semantic HTML:** I used appropriate HTML tags for better structure and SEO optimization.
- **Event Handling:** Incorporated JavaScript events directly into HTML tags for user interaction.
- **Local Storage:** Utilized HTML local storage to maintain the score across different sessions.

### CSS
- **Animations:** CSS animations were used to provide visual feedback for losses.
- **Flexbox:** I utilized the CSS Flexbox layout for aligning the game elements.
- **CSS Variables:** Utilized CSS variables to maintain consistency across styles.

### JavaScript
- **Event Listeners:** Created event listeners for user interactions (clicks and keydown events).
- **Game Logic:** Implemented the game logic using JavaScript conditional statements.

## Lessons Learned
This project deepened my understanding of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and gave me hands-on experience in creating a browser-based game. I learned how to make use of JavaScript event listeners, timers, and local storage, as well as how to animate elements with CSS.

## Future Work
I plan on improving my skills by creating more side projects to understand the correlation between JavaScript, CSS, and HTML better. I am also planning to learn and integrate more advanced JavaScript concepts and libraries, such as React, into my future projects.
